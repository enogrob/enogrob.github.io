## Hotwire devs, rejoice — Early Access for *Learn Hotwire* is now live!

Chris Oliver and William Kennedy have been quietly building something big — and they just pulled the curtain back.

After months of work (and a ton of feedback from early testers), their new course, **Learn Hotwire**, is finally available in **Early Access**:  
[learnhotwire.com](https://learnhotwire.com)

Here’s what’s already packed in:
- ✅ 110+ lessons  
- ✅ 8+ hours of content  
- ✅ Full coverage of Hotwire for Web (Turbo + Stimulus)  
- ✅ Real-world examples and patterns  
- ✅ More coming: Hotwire Native for iOS & Android drops later this week

To thank early adopters, they’re offering **$50 off** until April 30.

They didn’t wait for a pixel-perfect launch. They launched early, shipped fast, and are iterating with the community — just like any great product team would.

One of their testers said:  
> *“This is the course I wish I had… it’s deep, practical, and actually teaches you how things work.”*

And that’s the goal. Not just to teach Hotwire — but to **build mastery**.

It’s already the most comprehensive Hotwire course out there — and it’s only getting better.

If you're building with Hotwire (or curious to start), now’s the time to dive in:
