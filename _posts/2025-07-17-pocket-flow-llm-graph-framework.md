# **PocketFlow: The 100-Line LLM Framework That Makes Agents Actually Understandable**

## Hook with a Story

Picture this: You're at a tech meetup, and someone starts explaining their AI agent architecture. They mention LangChain's 405K lines of code, CrewAI's complex abstractions, and AutoGen's mysterious black boxes. Your eyes glaze over as they dive into the technical jargon.

Then someone else steps up and says: "What if I told you that **every AI agent is just a simple graph with 100 lines of code?**" 

That person would be talking about **PocketFlow** - the minimalist LLM framework that strips away all the complexity to reveal the beautiful simplicity underneath. No more wondering what's happening behind the scenes. No more vendor lock-in. Just pure, transparent agent logic you can actually understand.


## Lay Out the Roadmap

Here's our journey to mastering PocketFlow and understanding how LLM agents really work:

```mermaid!

    subgraph "Learning Journey"
        A[🎯 The Big Secret] --> B[🧩 Core Building Blocks]
        B --> C[🔍 Simple Research Agent]
        C --> D[⚡ Your First Implementation]
        D --> E[🚀 Real-World Applications]
        E --> F[🌟 Next Steps]

    style C fill:#e1f5fe
    style D fill:#f0f8e8
    style E fill:#fff8e1
    style F fill:#f3e5f5
```

**What you'll learn:**
1. Why agents are just simple graphs (not rocket science!)
2. The three building blocks that power everything
3. How to build a research agent in minutes
4. Why PocketFlow beats massive frameworks
5. How to apply this to real projects


## The Big Secret: Agents Are Just Simple Graphs!

### Wait, That's It? Really?

Yes! Here's the mind-blowing truth that complex frameworks try to hide:

```mermaid!
graph LR
    subgraph "Agent Decision Loop"
        A[🤔 Think] --> B{🔀 Decide}
        B -->|Search| C[🔍 Search Web]
        B -->|Answer| D[💬 Give Answer]
        C --> A
    end
    
    subgraph "Completion"
        D --> E[✅ Done]
    end
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#ffebee
```

Every AI agent, no matter how complex it seems, follows this pattern:
1. **Think** about the current situation
2. **Decide** what action to take next
3. **Do** the chosen action
4. **Loop** back to thinking with new information

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Even the most sophisticated frameworks like OpenAI Agents, LangChain, and LangGraph follow this exact pattern under the hood. PocketFlow just makes it visible!

### Your Turn: Spot the Pattern

Think about how **you** solve problems. Let's say someone asks: "What's the weather like in Tokyo?"

**Your mental process:**
1. 🤔 "I need current weather info"
2. 🔀 "Should I check my phone or ask someone?"
3. 📱 "I'll check a weather app"
4. 🤔 "Got the info, now I can answer"
5. 💬 "It's 22°C and sunny in Tokyo"

See? You're already thinking like an agent!


## Dive into Bite-Sized Chunks

### Building Block #1: Nodes (The Workers)

Think of **Nodes** as specialized workers in a kitchen:

```python
class SearchWebNode(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        # 🥄 Grab ingredients (get search query)
        return shared["search_query"]
    
    def exec(self, search_query):
        # 👨‍🍳 Do the actual work (search the web)
        results = google_search(search_query)
        return results
    
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        # 🍽️ Serve the dish (save results, decide what's next)
        shared["search_results"] = exec_res
        return "analyze_results"
```

**Every node has three simple jobs:**
- **Prep:** Gather what you need from the shared workspace
- **Exec:** Do your specialized task
- **Post:** Save your results and decide where to go next

### Your Turn: Design a Node

**Do this!** Imagine you're building a "TranslateText" node. What would each method do?
1. **Prep:** What information would you need?
2. **Exec:** What's the main task?
3. **Post:** Where should the flow go next?

*Think about it before reading on...*

**Quick Recap:** Nodes are like specialized workers that prep, execute, and hand off to the next worker.


### Building Block #2: Flow (The Recipe)

The **Flow** is like a recipe that tells workers where to go next:

```python
# Connect the nodes like a flowchart
search_node - "analyze" >> analyze_node
search_node - "answer" >> answer_node
analyze_node - "search_more" >> search_node
analyze_node - "answer" >> answer_node

# Create the flow starting with search
flow = Flow(start=search_node)
```

**Flow connections are simple:**
- `node1 - "action" >> node2` means "if node1 returns 'action', go to node2"
- It's just like following arrows in a flowchart!

### Your Turn: Connect the Dots

**Do this!** Draw arrows connecting these nodes:
1. **StartNode** → (if "needs_info") → **SearchNode**
2. **StartNode** → (if "can_answer") → **AnswerNode** 
3. **SearchNode** → (always) → **StartNode**

```mermaid!
graph LR
    subgraph "Flow Control"
        A[🚀 StartNode] --> B{🤔 Decision}
    end
    
    subgraph "Actions"
        B -->|needs_info| C[🔍 SearchNode]
        B -->|can_answer| D[💬 AnswerNode]
        C --> A
    end
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
```

**Quick Recap:** Flow is just a simple recipe that says "if this, then go there."


### Building Block #3: Shared Store (The Kitchen Counter)

The **Shared Store** is like a big kitchen counter where everyone can leave notes and ingredients:

```python
# Everyone can read and write to this shared space
shared = {
    "question": "What's the capital of France?",
    "search_results": "Paris is the capital...",
    "answer": "The capital of France is Paris."
}
```

**It's that simple:**
- All nodes can read from and write to this shared dictionary
- It's how information flows between different workers
- Think of it as everyone's shared notebook

### Your Turn: Design Your Shared Store

**Do this!** If you were building a "Recipe Generator" agent, what would you put in the shared store?

*Hint: Think about what information different nodes would need to share...*

**Quick Recap:** Shared store is just a dictionary where all nodes can read and write information.


## Graph Patterns: The Secret Sauce Behind Every Agent

### Wait, There Are Patterns?

Absolutely! Just like design patterns in software, AI agents follow predictable graph patterns. Once you know these patterns, you can build **any** agent by mixing and matching them.

**Think of it like LEGO blocks:** Each pattern solves a specific problem, and you combine them to build whatever you need!

<details>
<summary><strong>🔄 Pattern #1: The Simple Loop (Most Common)</strong></summary>

</details>

### Your Turn: Identify the Right Pattern

**Do this!** Match these business needs with design patterns:

1. **Process 50,000 customer service tickets for insights**
   - *Pattern:* `__________`

2. **Answer questions about company policies using internal docs**
   - *Pattern:* `__________`

3. **Create social media campaigns from product descriptions**
   - *Pattern:* `__________`

4. **Monitor website performance and auto-optimize**
   - *Pattern:* `__________`

**Pro Tip:** Most real applications combine multiple patterns! Start with one pattern, prove it works, then add complexity.

**Quick Recap:** These design patterns are battle-tested solutions to common business problems. Pick the right combination for your use case!

## Let's Build a Super Simple Research Agent

### The Goal: A Research Agent in 100 Lines

Here's the complete code for a simple research agent using PocketFlow:

```python
# Import the PocketFlow framework
from pocketflow import *

# Define the nodes
class InputNode(Node):
    def exec(self, question):
        print(f"🔍 Searching for: {question}")
        return "search_results"

class AnalyzeNode(Node):
    def exec(self, search_results):
        print(f"📊 Analyzing: {search_results}")
        return "answer"

class AnswerNode(Node):
    def exec(self, answer):
        print(f"✅ Answering: {answer}")
        return "done"

# Define the flow
search_node = InputNode("What's the capital of France?")
analyze_node = AnalyzeNode()
answer_node = AnswerNode()

search_node - "search_results" >> analyze_node
analyze_node - "answer" >> answer_node

flow = Flow(start=search_node)

# Run the agent
flow.run()
```

### How It Works

1. **InputNode:** Starts the flow by taking a question.
2. **SearchNode:** Pretends to search the web (replace with real search code).
3. **AnalyzeNode:** Analyzes the search results.
4. **AnswerNode:** Gives the final answer.

### Your Turn: Modify and Run

**Do this!** Change the question in `InputNode` to something else. Maybe "What's the weather today?" or "Who won the World Series in 2020?"

*Hint: You can also add more nodes for a more complex agent!*
